# web-scrape-project
A full stack project that will scrape listings data from various sites like Ebay using Nodejs and cheerio. I plan to use this project to further practice Reactjs on the frontend and to learn how to create a backend by possibly using Express and mongoDB.


### Planned features
 1. Web Scrapping(Nodejs, Cheerio)
    * [x] Scrape ebay listings
    * [ ] ~Scrape craigslist~(postponed till i figure out how to connect ebay scrape data first.) 
    * [x] get data from multiple pages (pagination)
 2. Backend(Mongodb,express)
    * [x] Make a database.
    * [x] Connect the database.
    * [ ] Figure out how to send scrapped data to this database (paritally complete)
 3. Frontend(Reactjs)
    * [ ] Create a search component.
    * [ ] Create a listings component.
    * [ ] Implement hooks.

### Updates
- 2/21/21 Added Ebay scrapping.
- 2/23/21 Switched from scrapping FB marketplace to another website due to the classes being to convoluted.
- 3/1/21  Pagination for ebay web scrapped data implemented.
- 3/5/21  Refactored the web scrapper to scrape fewer results.
- 3/6/21  Successfully connected the database to web scrapped data!
