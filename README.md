# web-scrape-project
A full stack project that will scrape listings data from various sites like Ebay and Fb Marketplace using Nodejs and cheerio. I plan to use this project to further practice Reactjs on the frontend and to learn how to create a backend by possibly using Express and mongoDB.

 2. Backend(Still choosing)
    * [ ] Make a database.
    * [ ] Connect the database.
    * [ ] Figure out how to send scrapped data to this database
 3. Frontend(Reactjs)
    * [ ] Create a search component.
    * [ ] Create a listings component.
    * [ ] Implement hooks.
